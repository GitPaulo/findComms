## TODO/Revive List

- [ ] Better caching or devise a better than bruteforce approach at searching.
- [ ] Additional filtering options
    - Go through a user's metadata, posts, etc. and **collect** #tags to be used for filtering
    - Follow and links in bio for additional information? (**webscrapping will be painful**)

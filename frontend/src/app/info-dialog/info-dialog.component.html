  <h1>findComms</h1>
  <p>
    findComms is a tool that searches twitter profiles for artists with
    stores/commissions/etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    findComms is powered by the public twitter API and therefore is limited by
    its rates.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      At the moment, users with followers in the thousands will not have full
      searches. (WIP)
    </b>
  </p>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>
    Simply search a user by id or display name (https://twitter.com/this_part)
    You can filter by adding the selector ':', cases:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>:following</li>
    <li>:followers</li>
    *the default search space is both.
  </ul>
  <p><b>Example:</b> MyDisplayName:followers</p>
  <p>That will search all of "MyDisplayName's" followers for artists.</p>

  <h2>Bug Reporting</h2>
